**Note**: Jupyterlabs can only open files which are UTF-8 encoded. If a file isn't UTF-8 encoded and must be accessed in Jupyterlabs, it can be downloaded and locally converted in your computer, and then uploaded to work with.

An error similar to the one shown below will be displayed, if a non UTF-8 encoded file is opened.
